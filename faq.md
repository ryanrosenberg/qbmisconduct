<h2>General Form Operations</h2>
<i>Who are the current representatives on the form and which organizations do they represent?</i>
<p>The current form representatives are Matthew Bollinger and Olivia Murton (<a href='https://acf-quizbowl.com'>ACF</a>), Emily Pike and Joel Gluskin (<a href='https://naqt.com'>NAQT</a>), Bernadette Spencer and Ryan Rosenberg (<a href='https://pace-nsc.org'>PACE</a>), and Kevin Wang (<a href='https://discord.gg/quizbowl'>Discord</a>).<p>

<i>When should I use the misconduct form?</i>
<p>You can use the form whenever you have concerns about inappropriate behavior from someone involved in quizbowl and any of the following are true:
<ul>
<li>You want any or all of the form’s member organizations (ACF, NAQT, PACE, or the main Quizbowl Discord) to begin disciplinary processes</li>
<li>You want your report to be passed on to another organization (e.g. a state or local quizbowl organization, a school, or some other group) that is not represented on the form</li>
<li>You aren’t sure what you want to have happen, or you want advice on what to do</li>
<li>You just want the organizations to be aware of what happened</li>
</ul></p>

<i>Does the form itself punish people for misconduct?</i>
<p>The ability to sanction the subjects of misconduct reports lies solely with the member organizations themselves. The form, as a group, does not decide, issue, or deliberate on punishments that a member organization could issue. The main function of the misconduct form is to determine which organization(s) should know about a report, and to make sure that information gets to the right places.</p>

<i>What happens after a report is submitted?</i>
<p>The representatives all receive an email as soon as a misconduct report is filed. Usually, the representatives discuss the report to plan how to respond to the reporter and which organizations should receive the report. Representatives may also follow up with each other about what, if any, consequences their own organizations have chosen to pursue. The misconduct form representatives do not, on their own, choose or enforce punishments for misconduct.</p>

<i>Is there any misconduct that the committee is legally required to report (e.g. to school authorities, law enforcement, etc.)?</i>
<p>While some of the current members may be required reporters in their home state while serving in their professional roles, none of the form representatives are legally bound to report specific behaviors reported via this form to law enforcement. However, there are certainly cases in which we would strongly encourage the reporter to inform the appropriate authorities.</p>

<i>In what settings can the form’s member organizations enforce consequences for misconduct?</i>
<p>The form’s member organizations make decisions for their organizations only. The form, and its member organizations, have no official authority over events that are run by other groups. For example, an organization might choose to bar someone from staffing its own national tournaments, but cannot bar that person from staffing local tournaments. The member organizations also do not have control over, for example, school clubs, unofficial social gatherings, or online social spaces other than the hsquizbowl forums or the main Quizbowl Discord.</p>

<i>I want a different organization (e.g. my local quizbowl organization, a school, a set production team) to respond to my report. Can I still use the misconduct form?</i>
<p>Yes. Reports can ask that information be shared with other organizations and we have honored those requests in the past. We can also help you reach out to other organizations directly if you prefer.</p>

<i>I’m concerned about misconduct that happened outside of an organization’s official event. Can I still report it?</i>
<p>Yes. Organizations can choose to impose consequences for misconduct regardless of where the misconduct occurs. However, consequences will still be limited to the organization’s own jurisdiction.</p>

<h2>Submitting Reports</h2>
<i>Can I reach out to only one or a few representatives listed on the form with a misconduct report? If so, what effect will this have on responses to that report?</i>
<p>Community members are welcome to reach out to select representatives; however, the misconduct form representatives (when acting as a group) generally only consider reports filed through the form. If you do not want to fill out the form yourself, you are welcome to designate someone else to do so on your behalf.</p>

<h2>Handling Reports</h2>
<i>What role do the reporter, and the person accused of misconduct, have in the process of responding to a report?</i>
<p>Both parties have a role in the process. If they stated that they’re okay with being contacted after submitting a report, the reporter is consulted when the committee has questions or needs more information about the report. If a report is passed on to any member organizations, those organizations generally reach out to the accused to obtain their side of the story. The organizations involved in the misconduct form give the accused person a chance to defend themselves before permanent sanctions are levied.</p>

<i>Are decisions on sanctions in response to a report blind to the name of the perpetrator?</i>
<p>The misconduct form representatives know the name of the alleged perpetrator when it is included in the report. Generally, that information is also passed on to the organizations, since organizations need this information in order to investigate the allegation and allow the alleged perpetrator to defend themselves. However, each member organization makes its own decisions on sanctions without regard to the person accused or their status in the community.</p>

<h2>Report Outcomes</h2>
<i>Is there a summary of outcomes of reports available?</i>
<p>Yes, you can view summary statistics about reports on the <a href = '/summary'>Report Summary</a> page.</p>

<i>What are the potential repercussions of a misconduct report? What sanctions might the subject of a report face?</i>
<p>The potential outcomes of a misconduct report vary from organization to organization based on their different misconduct processes. For the form member organizations, these may include: permanent playing, staffing, and/or writing bans; temporary suspensions; or loss of membership in the organization.</p>
